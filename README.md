## Usage

### Construct

Initialize the cookie consent framework with the constructor

```js
var cookieSettings = new BootstrapCookieConsent(props)
```

You may configure the framework with the `props` object. The default
configuration is

```js
this.props = {
    buttonAgreeClass: "btn btn-primary", // the "Agree to all" buttons class
    buttonDontAgreeClass: "btn btn-link text-decoration-none", // the "I do not agree" buttons class
    buttonSaveClass: "btn btn-secondary", // the "Save selection" buttons class
    autoShowModal: true, // disable autoShowModal on the privacy policy and legal notice pages, to make these pages readable
    postSelectionCallback: undefined, // callback function, called after the user has saved the settings
    lang: navigator.language, // the language, in which the modal is shown
    defaultLang: "en", // default language, if `lang` is not available as translation in `cookie-consent-content`
    contentURL: "./cookie-consent-content", // this URL must contain the language-files in the needed languages (`[lang].js`)
    privacyPolicyUrl: "privacy-policy.html", // the URL of your privacy policy page
    legalNoticeUrl: "legal-notice.html", // the URL of you legal notice page (Impressum)
    categories: ["necessary", "statistics", "marketing", "personalization"], // the categories for selection, must be contained in the language files
    cookieName: "cookie-consent-settings",  // the name of the cookie in which the configuration is stored as JSON
    cookieStorageDays: 365, // the duration the cookie configuration is stored on the client
    modalId: "bootstrapCookieConsentSettingsModal" // the id of the modal dialog element
}
```

### Show dialog again

On a new visit the dialog is shown automatically. 
For reconfiguration show the Dialog again with 

```js
cookieSettings.showDialog()
```

### Read the settings in JavaScript

Read all cookie settings with 

```js 
cookieSettings.getSettings()
```
It should return some JSON like

```json
{"necessary":true,"statistics":true,"marketing":true,"personalization":true}
```
or 
`undefined`, before the user has choosen his cookie options.

Read a specific cookie setting with

```js
cookieSettings.getSettings('statistics')
```
for the `statistics` cookie settings. Also returns `undefined`, before the user has choosen 
his cookie options.

### Read the settings with a PHP script on the server

You can read the settings with all server languages, you just have to read the cookie and decode the JSON.

This is an PHP example how to read, if 'statistics' was allowed. 

```PHP
$consentCookieJson = @$_COOKIE['cookie-consent-settings'];
if ($consentCookieJson) {
    $consentCookie = json_decode($consentCookieJson);
    if($consentCookie && $consentCookie->statistics) {
        // do statistics things here
    }
}
```

### Internationalization

you add language files please consider a pull request to also add them in this repository. Thanks.
